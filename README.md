# Hi, I'm Graydon

- I am currently working on building a variety of construction management tools
- I am currently learning how much I hate developing iOS apps on a Windows machine :))
- I like to think I am good at system architecture, and am always open to collaborative work, especially the profitable kind.
- I am not looking for help with current work
- Reach out at jetplaneai@gmail.com
- This emoticon is pretty sweet: `(-_(-_(-_-)_-)_-)`
