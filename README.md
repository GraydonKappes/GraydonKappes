Hi, my name is Graydon 

-I am currently working on building a variety of construction management tools
-I am currently learning how much I hate developing IOS apps on a windows machine :))
-I like to think I am good at system architecture, and am always open to collaborative work, especially profitable collaborative work.
-I am not looking for help with current work
-Reach out at jetplaneai@gmail.com

-This emoticon is pretty sweet: (-_(-_(-_-)_-)_-)
